This is my stack overflow annual developer survey project. Here 90,000 developers from across the world chimed in on what role they have, experience, salary, methods of learning to code as well as technolgies they use at work and what they would want to use. I used python to analyze this annual survey to answer questions below.
 
 	Questions:
	- At what companies do developers get paid the most?
	- how much does remote working mater to employees
	- How does coding experiences affect level of pay
	- Whats the most popular method of learning to code
	- More likely to get job as a developer with masters degree?
